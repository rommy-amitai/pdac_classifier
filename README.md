This work aims to build a classifier that detects pancreatic cancer at its early stages, with the use of a single blood test.
This work here contains the files I wrote to tranform the raw data (dna sequencing) into input data for several ML algorithms. 
I then testes and trained these algorithms, and analyzed them using statistical tools.
